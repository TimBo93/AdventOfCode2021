### about
This repo contains solutions for [Advent Of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021).
To add spice to it, I use different "programming languages", some I've never used before.

### contribute
If you want to challenge me, write me a programming language and let's go. How about Prolog, Basic or MatLab?

#### notes
\* Day 8 : Due to time constraints, I decided to use my home zone programming language.
Possibly I will re-implement this in another language.
Anyway: a code can't get any dirtier than this. 🤣

\* Day 21: Part 2 produces the right solution. Unfortunately it is reeeaaaly slow and hungry for RAM.
If you are not holding a power computer, you probably do not want to run it till a score of 21.
There may (?) be an easy solution with some memoization (aka dynamic programming) but my Haskell skills are not sufficient enough to get this done. To overcome my weakness, I transpiled the algorithm into .NET, utilized a Dictionary and was happy.
