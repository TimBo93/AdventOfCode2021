### about
This repo contains solutions for [Advent Of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021).
To add spice to it, I use different "programming languages", some I've never used before.

### contribute
If you want to challenge me, write me a programming language and let's go. How about Prolog, Basic or MatLab?

#### notes
\* Day 8 : Due to time constraints, I decided to use my home zone programming language.
Possibly I will re-implement this in another language.
Anyway: a code can't get any dirtier than this. 🤣
